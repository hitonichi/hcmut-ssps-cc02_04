# HCMUT SPSS: A smart printing service for students at HCMUT

HCMUT SPSS is a dedicated platform designed to facilitate students at HCMUT in printing documents easily and conveniently. The system allows a student to print a document,choose a printer, and specifying the printing properties such as paper size, pages (of the file) to be printed, one-/double-sided, number of copies and printing requests will be sent to the printing service. Additionally, the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO) can monitor usage patterns and configure various printing properties using the system.

# Features
- Upload a printing document file via website.
- Choose a preferred printer from available options within the system.
- Specify printing properties such as paper size, pages to be printed, one-/double-sided, number of copies, paper orientation.
- View personal printing usage for a time period with a summary of number of printed pages for each page size.
- Buying papers via Buy Printing Pages with BKPay supported.
- Allow SPSO to add/enable/disable a printer, modify the system policy such as changing the default number of pages, the dates that the system will give the default number of pages to all students, the permitted file types accepted by the system.

# Limitations
- Require staffs to handle printing tasks.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
